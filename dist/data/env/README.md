# Environment maps

**Notice:** Most of these environment maps has been generated using cmft based on cubemaps from Humus (which are licensed CC Attribution 3.0 Unported).

To generate environmentmaps, put 6 files called `negx.jpg`, `negy.jpg`, `negz.jpg`, `posx.jpg`, `posy.jpg`, `posz.jpg` into a directory and run `tools/scripts/cmgen`. **For convenience, this script will destroy the originals.**  This script needs `cmft` and `imagemagick` to run. If you want to support other filetypes, change the script.
